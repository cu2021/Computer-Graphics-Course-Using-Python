# Computer Graphics Course â€“ OpenGL Project

This repository contains code files and practical examples developed for a Computer Graphics course using Python and OpenGL. The main entry point is `firstAttempt.py`, and additional scripts demonstrate various concepts from the course.

## Features

- Example implementations of core computer graphics concepts
- Python OpenGL rendering with interactive demos
- Modular scripts for different topics (e.g., transformations, lighting, shading)
- Easy to extend for new assignments or experiments

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyOpenGL
- NumPy
- (Optional) Pillow, PyGLM, or other libraries as needed
