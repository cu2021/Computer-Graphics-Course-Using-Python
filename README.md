# Computer Graphics Course Using Python

This repository contains a collection of examples and exercises developed for a Computer Graphics course, utilizing Python and OpenGL. It serves as a practical resource for students and enthusiasts to explore fundamental concepts in computer graphics through hands-on coding.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

* **`firstAttempt.py`**: Initial setup and basic OpenGL window creation.
* **`MakingLineDrawings.py`**: Demonstrates line drawing techniques using OpenGL.
* **`drawPolyLineFile.py`**: Reads coordinate data from files and renders polylines.
* **`DrawingTheSierpinskiGasket.py`**: Illustrates recursive drawing of the Sierpinski Gasket fractal.
* **`DotPlot(Curve).py`**: Plots curves using dot representations.
* **`BigDipper.py`**: Renders the Big Dipper constellation using coordinate data.
* **`data/`**: Contains data files (e.g., `dino.dat`) used for polyline rendering.
* **`MakingLineDrawings.py`**: Plots curves using line strips.
* **`hardwireHouse.py`**: Drawing a house by defining all its vertices coordinates.
* **`parameterizedHouse.py`**: Drawing a house by defining only the peak coordinates, the house width, and its height. 
* **`drawPolyLine.py`**: Drawing Polyline using drawPolyLine Function. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.7 or higher
* [PyOpenGL](https://pypi.org/project/PyOpenGL/)
* [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate numpy
```



## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cu2021/Computer-Graphics-Course-Using-Python.git
   cd Computer-Graphics-Course-Using-Python
   ```



2. **Run an example**:

   ```bash
   python firstAttempt.py
   ```



Replace `firstAttempt.py` with any other script to explore different examples.
